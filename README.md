NOTE:
The code for the main site, carbonchen.site, unfortunately did not get backed up
before I destroyed the DigitalOcean virtual machine and cancelled the domain name.
Basically, it was a landing page with a script that scraped visitors' web vitals and
browser details. This info was fetched to a PHP endpoint which queried the data
to the MySQL database.
